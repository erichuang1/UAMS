# UAMS
A simulation of User Account Management System

## Getting Started

The system operates in two distinct stages. Stage 1 is dedicated to the login process, while Stage 2 encompasses a wide array of user actions and essential commands.

To interact with the system, simply type the command without trailing information. If required, the system should prompt you to input extra information for the task. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (no external dependency is used)
- `docs`: the folder to containing the documentation and project outline

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
